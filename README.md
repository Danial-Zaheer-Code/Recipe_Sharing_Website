# Recipe Sharing Website

Welcome to the Recipe Sharing Website project! This project is a simple web application that allows users to view, add, and search for recipes. It's a great way to learn and apply HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following sections:

1. **Home**: A welcome page with a brief introduction and featured recipes.
2. **Recipes**: A page listing all available recipes with links to their details.
3. **Add Recipe**: A form where users can submit new recipes.
4. **Recipe Details**: A page displaying the details of a selected recipe.
5. **Search**: A section where users can search for recipes by title or ingredient.
